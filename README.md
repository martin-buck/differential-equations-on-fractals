# differential-equations-on-fractals
An implementation of finite elements to approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation on the Sierpinski Gasket fractal. This is based on a method developed in the paper "The Finite Element on the Sierpisnki Gasket" by Michael Gibbons, Arjun Raj, and Robert Strichartz.

You can run it in Google Colab!
